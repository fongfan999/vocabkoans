# Welcome to Vocabulary Koans
## What the heck is it?
Vocabulary Koans ([@vocabkoans](https://m.me/vocabkoans)) is an application that will remind users to learn new vocabularies daily via the Facebook Messenger platform.

Fotin, the bot name, will deliver new vocabulary at around 1 hour intervals from the morning to the evening until user's the number of the vocabularies a day is reached. Just one more thing, the bot will not deliver a new vocabulary if the last one isn't marked as read.
